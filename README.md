# BID MASTERS
This project was created by InÃªs Cruz, Maria Farran Colell and Ricardo Nunes
## Description
Bid Masters is a platform used by Art Galleries to sell their art. There are constant auctions and the sellers can see a description and picture of the painting whilst betting on it. Artists can also use the site to directly sell their art without the need of a third party.
