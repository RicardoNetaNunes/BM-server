# BID MASTERS

This project was made by Ines Cruz, Ricardo Nunes and Maria Farran Colell 

## Description

Bid Masters is a platform used by Art Galleries to sell their art. There are constant auctions and the sellers can see a description and picture of the painting whilst betting on it. Artists can also use the site to directly sell their art without the need of a third party.
